                <h3>&#8855; My story. &#8853;</h3>
				
                <p>	 Hey there, I am Kevin, and this? This is my story. That was a little more dramatic than it actually is,
				 but, there is a little drama in everyones life. I lived in Pennsylvania for most of my life before coming here to
				 St. Louis. Actually to be more accurate before even coming to St. Louis I lived in New Jersey for 7 months before
				 family drove me crazy. I saved money and planned to move away. Plans changed and so did my directions when I saw LaunchCode</p>

                <p>	So after arriving in St. Louis I took my project in their office. This is where I first time I've met Koko. My project
				I showed wasn't up to par for an actual intership but gave me some advice on how to improve, sadly it isn't something that I
				could do without some verbal communication. Theres a lot of ways to solve problems online but some problems just require help from
				someone else</p>

                <p>	Currently I am in a science room with my TA Jeff and some of my classmates working on html-me-something. I feel like I know nothing
				whenever I get in this room. Im trucking along the best I can hoping to keep up with my classmates. HTML is pretty fun to use although I am
				rather new to it. I wouldnt mind doing more stuff like this. </p>
				
                <p>	Outside of LaunchCode I am trying to get a job to help me live in St. Louis recently I think I might have gotten something but unsure. . .
				tune in next episode.</p>

                <p>	If I manage to make it to the end I hope for an internship and maybe some friends here in St. Louis since i've left most of mine behind.
				I hope to reach a place where I can take care of my mom, just like she took care of me. </p>
